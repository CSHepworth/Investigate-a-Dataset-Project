# Project 1
## Question 1: How have budget and revenue changed over the time period covered by the dataset?
![Average Budget and Revenue By Year](/avg_budget_revenue_by_year.png "average budget and revenue by year")
### We see that the average budget and revenue relatively match each other with both increasing and peaking around the year 2000 and then starting to decline

## Question 2: How has net income changed over time?
![Average Net Income By Year](/avg_net_income_by_year.png "average net income by year")
### Net income seems to follow a similar path to revenue. This could suggest that budget has less of an effect than revenue on net income.

## Question 3: What is the relationship between budget and revenue? Budget and net income? Revenue and net income?
![Relationship Between Budget and Revenue](/relationship_between_budget_and_revenue.png "relationship between budget and revenue")
### There is a correlation between budget and revenue, however it is not very strong
![Relationship Between Budget and Net Income](/relationship_between_budget_and_net_income.png "relationship between budget and net income")
### The correlation between budget and net income is weaker than budget and revenue
![Relationship Between Revenue and Net Income](/relationship_between_revenue_and_net_income.png "relationship between revenue and net income")
### The correlation between revenue and net income is by far the strongest. This suggests that a film's financial success is not based on the budget but other factors (i.e. marketing, quality, actors, director, genre, etc.)

## Question 4: Are films with longer runtimes more expensive to make?
![Relationship Between Budget and Runtime](/relationship_between_budget_and_runtime.png "relationship between budget and runtime")
### There is not a strong correlation between budget and runtime.

## Question 5: Do longer or shorter films make more money?
![Relationship Between Revenue and Runtime](/relationship_between_revenue_and_runtime.png "relationship between revenue and runtime")
### No strong correlation.

## Question 6: Do longer or short films receive higher ratings?
![Relationship Between Runtime and Average Ratings](/relationship_between_runtime_and_average_ratings.png "relationship between runtime and average ratings")
### There is some correlation to suggest that longer movies are better rated.

## Question 7: Who are the top 10 directors by total revenue?
![Top 10 Directors by Total Revenue](/top_10_revenue_directors.png "top 10 directors by total revenue")
### Steven Spielberg brings in the most revenue

## Conclusion
* Budget is not the key driver of revenue and net income
* The length of a film does not necessarily cost more, nor does it affect the revenue made.
* Longer films may receive higher ratings
* Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, and James Cameron have the highest total revenue made over all of their films.
